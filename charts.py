"""The look every chart in the app shares.

Streamlit's chart theme draws text at 12px (axis numbers, legends, pie and bar labels,
annotations), 14px (axis titles) and 16px (chart titles), which read small, and draws
axis numbers, axis titles and annotations in grey. Every size here is 50% larger, and
all chart text is black. Charts are 50% taller too: a page sets the height a chart
would naturally have (or none, for Streamlit's 450px default) and :func:`readable`
scales it. Pass each figure through :func:`readable` once, last, right before
``st.plotly_chart``, so it also reaches annotations added along the way.
